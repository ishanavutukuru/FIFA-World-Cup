  <center><h2>What is the World Cup?</h2></center>
      <center><p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup was an international football tournament made up of the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations and 22nd year of the FIFA World Cup that was won by Argentina. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, making it the first World Cup held in the Arab world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. <br><br>

This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate the event was held the winter months. It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight stadiums across five cities. The Qatar national football team entered the World Cup automatically since they were the the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process. <br><br>

Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third win since 1986, as well being the first nation from South America to win the tournament since 2002. <br><br>
        
The choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women and members of the LGBT community, as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.</p></center>

  <section><h3><center>Stadium 974</center></h3>
  <center><p>pened 30 November 2021, it is a temporary venue, made from 974 recycled shipping containers, that hosted matches during the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, after which dismantlement began. It was the first temporary venue in FIFA World Cup history. <br><br>
    
Stadium 974 is named after Qatar's international dialling code, as well as the number of shipping containers used to build its staircases, kiosks, bathrooms and parts of its exterior.<br><br>

Designed by Fenwick-Iribarren Architects, the colourful building pays homage to Qatar's history as well as the industrial heritage of its site near Doha's port.<br><br>

The containers, many of which were originally used to transport materials to the site, feature alongside a modular steel structure that was developed to be demounted and repurposed. The 40,000-seat venue will host its first match on 30 November. </p>

<section><h3><center>Al Janoub Stadium</center></h3>
  <center><p>To the south of central Doha in Al Wakrah is the Al Janoub Stadium, a building featuring the signature sweeping forms of its co-architect Zaha Hadid Architects.<br><br>

The 40,000-seat venue, which will host its first match on 22 November, was created in collaboration with AECOM and features a fully retractable roof to help keep players and fans cool.<br><br>

The stadium features a curvilinear postmodernist and neo-futurist design. The appearance of the roof was inspired by the sails of traditional Dhow boats, used by pearl divers from the region, weaving through currents of the Persian Gulf. <br><br>

It will be the official seat of the football club Al-Wakrah SC, where matches for the Qatar Stars League will be held. The capacity of the stadium is 40,000, which is expected to be reduced to 20,000 after the World Cup.<br><br>

The stadium is located about 22 km south of Doha.</p>

  <center>Dubbed a "diamond in the desert", the Education City Stadium is the eighth and final venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar. Its first match is on 22 November. <br><br>

The stadium's nickname refers to its facade, which is composed of a diamond-like pattern that takes its form from traditional Arabic architecture. It is designed to deflect strong sunlight and can be illuminated at night. <br><br>

After the games, there are plans for the venue to be converted into a sports hub for the Education City district where it is located, with its top tier of seating removed to make room for university classrooms and event spaces. <br><br>
  
The stadium is located within several university campuses at the Qatar Foundation's Education City.Following the FIFA World Cup, the stadium will retain 25,000 seats for use by university athletic teams, when it held over 45,000 for the World Cup. On 3 September 2020, the stadium hosted its first official match, played in the 2020â€“21 Qatar Stars League season. <br><br>

The stadium is in Al Rayyan, Qatar and is located about 7 km north-west of Doha.</p>
